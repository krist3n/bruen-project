# Bruen
Bruen Project for my Summer 2024 Data Analytics Internship at the Bronx Defenders (BxD). W/ Max Gilligan.

## Description of Project

Analysis of the impact of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n (NYSRPA II) v. Bruen Supreme Court Ruling (2022). During that case, the BxD wrote an amicus brief in support of the NYSRPA, on the grounds that the NYS Sullivan Law disproportionately criminalized Black and Hispanic and low-income residents of the Bronx. The BxD suspected that there was little change in the way criminal possession of weapon charges (CWP) were handled in New York State - just based on anecdotal evidence from their lawyers. We set out to quantitatively analyze whether this was true, using variables like CWP counts, % of Bail Set or Remanded in CWP cases, proportion of CWP vs. Overall Felonies, etc.. We also compared variables across NYS, NYC, and the Bronx, as well as variables across race/ethnicity.

Ultimately, we found that there was no significant changes between CWP charges pre- and post- Bruen ruling.
